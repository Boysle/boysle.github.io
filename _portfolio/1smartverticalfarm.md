This is a smart and semi-automated vertical farming system, adaptable to various plant types for household users, addressing the challenges urban residents face in growing their own agricultural products. The crops are cultivated in layers to optimize space, with nutrient-enriched water used to nourish the growing plants.

There are multiple control mechanisms integrated into a compact vertical system, with necessary components selected based on thorough technical analysis and design constraints. The system automatically monitors and adjusts the pH levels and nutrient concentration in the water, while tracking temperature and moisture to maintain optimal growing conditions for the plants. A smartphone alert system notifies users if any undesired conditions arise.

A report is written with an emphasis on the selection of agricultural products, exploration of alternative solutions, mechanical design, integrated pump mechanism, lighting system, and nutrition and pH control.
