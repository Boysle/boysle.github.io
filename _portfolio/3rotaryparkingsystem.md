### Overview

A functional small-scale rotary parking system prototype that works with model cars to save space by going vertically in open parking lots.

Two Arduino UNOs, a stepper motor, and other electronic components are used for the control mechanism. The structure is built with interlinkable beams, pins, and gears. 

The code is written in C++ to create "the most efficient path" algorithm that switches parking spots to save energy up to 20% and reduce waiting times for customers.
