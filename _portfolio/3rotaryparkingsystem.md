A functional small-scale rotary parking system that works with model cars to save space by going vertically in open parking lots.

Arduino UNO and other electronic components are used for the control mechanism. The structure is built with interlinkable beams, pins, and gears. 

The code is written in C++ to create ”the most efficient path” algorithm that switches parking spots to save energy up to 20% and reduce waiting times for customers.
