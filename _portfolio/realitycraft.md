We present RealityCraft, an AR interface that enables in-situ computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD+CAM) for novices. 

Unlike existing CAD systems that are limited to traditional screens, RealityCraft allows users to design directly within their physical environments. 

It introduces easy-to-use, non-parametric primitives for spatial and improvisational design tasks, integrating seamlessly with the real world.
