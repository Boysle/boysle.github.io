### Abstract

Despite the growing accessibility of augmented reality (AR) for visualization, existing computer-aided design systems remain largely confined to traditional screens and are often inaccessible to novice users due to their complexity. 

We present RealityCraft, an open-sourced AR interface that enables in-situ computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD+CAM) for novices. 

Unlike traditional CAD systems confined to computer screens, RealityCraft allows users to design directly within their physical environments, with primitive geometries. 

RealityCraft recognizes and utilizes physical constraints such as furniture and walls, enhancing user interaction through spatial awareness and depth occlusion. 

Furthermore, RealityCraft features an integrated AR-based 3D printing workflow, where users can drag and drop designs onto their 3D printer's virtual twin in their immediate space. 

Through a user study, we demonstrate that RealityCraft enhances engagement and ease of use for novices. 

By bridging the gap between digital creation and physical output, RealityCraft aims to transform everyday spaces into creative studios.
