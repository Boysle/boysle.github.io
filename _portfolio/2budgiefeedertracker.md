The mechanism includes a sensitive weight sensor to track whenever the bird lands on the feeder.

An Arduino UNO equipped with a serial Wi-Fi module is used to collect and transmit weight data to an IoT analytics framework.

Users can track their bird's weight and eating hours, providing an understanding of their overall health and habits.
