Education
======
* MS in Computer Engineering, Bogazici University, September 2022 - January 2026
* BS in Mechanical Engineering, Bogazici University, September 2017 - June 2022

Work Experience
======
* **Kordsa**, **Software Engineer**, March 2022 - October 2022

  (Remote) San Diego, California
  * Developed a application with Unity Engine using C# to simulate the manufacturing of composite honeycomb
structure. The program includes interactive visual animations and informative graphs.
  * With the help of the application, the produced material throughput efficiency has increased by 50%. The
produced materials are distributed to organizations such as NASA and Airbus.

* **Turkish Aerospace Industries**, **R&D Engineer Intern**, Aug. 2021 - Sep. 2021

  Ankara, Turkey
  * Did research and development for 3D computational analysis of mechanical components of aircraft.

* **FEV**, **Computer Aided Engineering Intern**, July 2021 - Aug. 2021

  Istanbul, Turkey
  * Created a tool that generates 3D polygonal modeled mesh groups using Python for Abaqus, with the aim of automatizing manual meshing, increasing efficiency by 5.
