I am a Master student in the [Computer Engineering Department](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) at [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_US) under the supervision of [Prof. Suzan Üsküdarlı](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/tr/people/suzan.uskudarli). I am currently involved in [Complex Systems Research Lab (SoSLab)](http://soslab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) and [Cognitive Learning and Robotics (COLORS) Lab](https://colors.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/).

My research interests encompass graph neural networks, sports analytics, ontologies, mixed reality, and computer-aided design and manufacturing.

I received my BS degree from [Mechanical Engineering Deptartment](http://www.me.boun.edu.tr/) at [Bogazici University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_US). My graduation project was completed under the supervision of [Prof. Hasan Bedir](http://me.boun.edu.tr/?q=users/hasan-bedir).
